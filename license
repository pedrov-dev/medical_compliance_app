## Summary

By adding GitHub integration and Docker containerization, the updated architecture now covers:

- **Version Control with GitHub**: Structured repository with a proper `.gitignore` and documentation.
- **Containerization**: Dockerfiles for both the backend and frontend; a Docker Compose file for easy orchestration.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: A GitHub Actions workflow file that installs dependencies, lints code, and builds Docker images on each push or pull request.

This complete setup ensures a smooth development and deployment experience for your Medical Compliance RAG web application.
